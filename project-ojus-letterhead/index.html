<p>Designing for modern browsers has allowed for the use of powerful scripting languages for a while now. The ability to generate random numbers through these scripting languages can be further used to create unique web-to-print situations. In this instance, I modified a randomization script created by Lukas to randomly color and skew existing letterforms and place these newly modified letters in a border. If this script was used for personal letterhead that was generated and printed from the browser, each letter would be unique and could be a direct aesthetic response to the content of the letter. That's also contingent upon people still sending letters, which I suspect happens at an extremely low rate.</p>
