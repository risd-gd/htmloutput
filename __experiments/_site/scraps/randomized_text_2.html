        Today, I met a lady who carries around a bubble sword. Everyday, she takes it everywhere she goes. It is a huge brightly colored child’s toy that makes giant bubbles, sheathed neatly within the nylon waistband of her fanny pack. I asked her why she always carried it around, and she said it was her therapy. “I’ve had a lot of deaths,” she said. Like a cat? How many? How many did she have left? I began to include the possibility that she was out of her damn mind. Rather, she explained, that after tragically losing her father, then her husband, and then her son, she would find herself anxious and consumed by the past, oftentimes so afraid of the unknown future and it’s potential losses that she wouldn’t do anything, go anywhere; she would just wallow in the pain of her own memories, her own self pity, and suffocate. She makes bubbles, she says, to remind her to be in the present. “They only last a few seconds, or a minute if you’re lucky, but you have to be in the present - y’know, here - to witness how pretty they are.” She didn’t think about the bubbles she made before, or would make, only what she could float across Halsted Street, whatever was happening that moment. She made some really great ones before she left, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had met her before.
