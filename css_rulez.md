HEYâ€¦ some CSS rules:

1. Avoid really big containers! We cannot break them if they span multiple pages and this makes formatting difficult. 
2. Also avoid adding CSS into your individual pages, and anything more than absolutely necessary to the template pages. 
3. style.css is the BASE CSS for **all content**. web.css adds anything additional for the website; book.css adds anything additional for the book (e.g. written-out URLs)
