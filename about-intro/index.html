<p class="indentanswer">This <span class="noprinty">website</span> <span class="printy">book</span> combines conversations with practicing designers with three months of graphic output created for, with and in a Web browser but to be usable in most any context. <span class="printy">The book itself was paginated within a Web browser without desktop fonts or a cursor. </span> <span class="printy">This website prints to a small paperback book.</span> Think of the project as a "responsive" website that at any point in its development can be output to a printable pdf. </p>

<p class="indentanswer">The web version is search-indexible, and widely available. The book is an ideal place to read, annotate and archive the projects and conversations. Could every website produce a book as an archive? A book does not lose compatibility or functionality, but it is limited in reach, static, higher in cost, and increasingly secondary when mulitple formats of a project are generated. </p>

<p class="indentanswer">In addition to testing the possibilities of how a website outputs to a book, the project was developed in Github Pages and Jekyl. This allowed the 12-person group to edit each other's text and develop the site in unison. There are some simple bi-products of this. Green underlines show where one classmate marked another's interview. Footnotes are generated automatically anytime there is a URL in the content. </p>

<p class="indentanswer">The graphical browser turned 20 years old last year. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/04/0422mosaic-web-browser/">NCSA Mosaic</a>, created at the University of Illinois, supported images of 216 colors in <em>gif</em> format using an HTML tag called <em>img</em>. What began as a project to structure and share academic content, The World Wide Web quickly served as a distribution center for designs conceived for the printed page. Static designs and image assets were downsampled and placed online as additional output.</p>

<p class="indentanswer">The web browser of this decade has reversed this workflow &mdash; with the web becoming primary in design emphasis and sophistication. As a rendering engine, the browser itself can display live type and shapes with output almost indistinguishable from any Adobe product. APIs, animation and user-interaction, are a few examples of why the browser has become a more satisfying place to site projects &mdash; even for non-browser consumption. As a design tool, the browser allows for direct engagement with its display through the web socket and web inspector. As <span class="name">Dan Michaelson</span> states in our conversation, &ldquo;cars don&lsquo;t let you change their design while they're running, but web browsers do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indentanswer">The recent advances in the web browser are so robust, that it has become my go-to tool in developing almost any project. Working within an IDE or the Web Inspector allows for both loose and measured adjustments with several taps of an arrow key. I first discovered this in 2011 while showing students how to make patterns in HTML and CSS. By altering numbers in CSS, whole layouts shifted, causing reflows and unexpected crops. Each tap of the keyboard producing a radically different formal solution.

<p class="indentanswer">
And as it turns out, this pleasure and discovery translates to more everyday design problems: flyers, posters, and books. Creating designs through the manipulation of text and numbers in the Web Inspectors provides realtime feedback in the browser &mdash; leading to many unexpected visual and programmatic outcomes found in this book. </p>
