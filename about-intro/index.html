<p class="indentanswer noindent">The graphical browser turned 20 years old last year. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/04/0422mosaic-web-browser/">NCSA Mosaic</a> supported 256 colors images in <em>gif</em> format using the newly minted <em>img</em> tag. Designed as a project to structure and share academic content, The World Wide Web quickly evolved into a distribution hub for designs intended for the printed page. Static designs and image assets were downsampled and placed online as additional output.</p>

<p class="indentanswer">The web browser of this decade has reversed this workflow &mdash; the web now pulls larger audiences and elicits greater design attention. As a rendering engine, the browser itself can display live type and shapes with output almost indistinguishable from print-based tools. APIs<footnote>Application Programming Interface</footnote>, animation and user input are a few reasons why the browser has become a more satisfying place to site projects &mdash; even for non-browser consumption. As a design tool, the browser allows for direct engagement with its display through the web socket and Web Inspector. As Dan Michaelson states in our conversation, &ldquo;cars don&lsquo;t let you change their design while they're running, but web browsers do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indentanswer">The recent advances in the web browser are so robust, that it has become my go-to tool in developing almost any project. Working within an IDE<footnote>Integrated Development Environment</footnote> or the Web Inspector allows for both loose and measured adjustments with several taps of an arrow key. I first discovered this in 2011 while teaching students HTML and CSS. I had them design patterns in the browser. By altering numbers in the Web Inspector, whole layouts shifted, causing reflows and unexpected crops. Each tap of the keyboard producing a radically different formal solution.

And as it turns out, this pleasure and discovery translates to more everyday design problems: flyers, posters, and books. Creating designs through the manipulation of text and numbers provides real-time feedback in the browser &mdash; leading to many unexpected visual and programmatic outcomes found <span class="printy">in this book</span><span class="noprinty">on this website</span>.</p>
