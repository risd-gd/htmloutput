<p>This <span class="noprinty">website</span> <span class="printy">book</span> combines conversations with practicing designers with three months of graphic output created for, with and in a Web browser but to be usable in most any context. <span class="printy">The book itself was paginated within a Web browser without desktop fonts or a cursor. </span> <span class="printy">This website prints to a small paperback book.</span> Think of it as a "responsive" website that at any point in its development could output to a pdf. </p>

<p>The web version is search-indexible, and widely available. The book is an ideal place to read, annotate and archive the projects and conversations. The Web will change, the project will no longer work. But the book is a final format. Could every website produce a book as an archive? It does not lose compatibility or functionality, but it's becoming secondary as a content delivery mechanism. </p>
