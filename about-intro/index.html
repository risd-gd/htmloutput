<p>This <span class="noprinty">website</span> <span class="printy">book</span> combines conversations with practicing designers with three months of experimental projects that use the web browser to create off-browser forms: event ephemera, wallpaper and textiles, videos and a book. <span class="printy">This book in your very hands was printed from a web browser. </span> <span class="printy">This website prints to a small paperback book.</span> A "responsive" website that at any point in its development could output to a pdf. </p>

<p>The two forms each offer something distinct, and complementary. The web version is search-indexible, and widely available. A book is an ideal place for designers to archive and present their work in a physical format. Unlike the web, the book is a final format. It cannot lose compatibility or functionality. Links cannot get broken, it cannot be updated, and it cannot be edited. It can be reprinted but each individual book is an archive of a specific time and state.</p>

<p>Both website and book come from the same codebase, available on <a href="https://github.com/risd-gd/htmloutput">Github</a>. </p>
