<p class="indentanswer">This <span class="noprinty">website</span> <span class="printy">book</span> combines conversations with practicing designers with three months of graphic output created for, with and in a Web browser but to be usable in most any context. <span class="printy">The book itself was paginated within a Web browser without desktop fonts or a cursor. </span> <span class="printy">This website prints to a small paperback book.</span> Think of the project as a "responsive" website that at any point in its development can be output to a printable pdf. </p>

<p class="indentanswer">The web version is search-indexible, and widely available. The book is an ideal place to read, annotate and archive the projects and conversations. Could every website produce a book as an archive? A book does not lose compatibility or functionality, but it is limited in reach, static, higher in cost, and increasingly secondary when mulitple formats of a project are generated. </p>

<p class="indentanswer">In addition to testing the possibilities of how a website outputs to a book, the project was developed in Github Pages and Jekyl. This allowed the 12-person group to edit each other's text and develop the site in unison. There are some simple bi-products of this. Green underlines show where one classmate marked another's interview. Footnotes are generated automatically anytime there is a URL in the content. </p>
