<p>The graphical browser turned 20 years old last year. NCSA Mosaic, created at the University of Illinois, was able to support the Compuserv Gif format. Designers began to drop images of all sorts in the browser. At times, complete designs (like version 1 of The New York Times). The workflow was from print to web. </p>
<p>Twenty years later, the browser is a formidable means of displaying graphic work. Etc.</p>

<p>I find myself increasingly disdainful of all the palettes required when designing print pieces with Adobe products. It's not really Adobe's fault. First it was Aldus Pagemaker, then QuarkXPress, and now Adobe InDesign. The conveniences are manifold, but with each tool comes opportunity and limitation. 
</p>

<p>
  My tool of choice for most any project -- posters, documents, and even books -- is the Web browser. The browser is not even a tool, really, it's the rendering engine that compiles text instructions.  
</p>

<p>
 Every tool has its purpose. Early dot matrix output was based on an infinite scroll of paper, perforated to allow for tearing. The need to control or managed the display of the data seems perfunctory. 
</p>
<p>

 David Reinfurt refers to responsivity as an important aspect of process. That a process of immediate feedback is valuable in terms of making adjustments. Tools for making that allow for an "aha" moment seem critical when faced when infinite options. 
</p>
<p>

 I have been using the Web Inspector for the last couple years to make adjustments to designs. Designing patterns is perhaps the simplest way to make this process clear. Whereas a dialog box might be needed to make global adjustments in Illustrator, altering margins or border width in the browser can provide immediate access to a multitude of ideas.  
</p>
<p>

 This real-time working process, where the rendering engine and the tool become one. The volley between plan and result gets collapsed into one act. This is more than an issue of speed. There is a cognitive shift, from pre-meditated to reactive. Each tap of the keyboard alters one number, but in doing so, the entirety of the composition changes.  
</p>

<p>Moving a mouse with your hand while looking at how the screen translates that act has its own potential for surprise. But it's really a simulation of a purely manual acts, such as collaging images together. And although adjusting numbers in the browser's Web Inspector is quantitative, it is more identical to collage than WYSIWYG design methods.</p>

<p>In regards to practical project</p>

<p>Eugeny Morozov reminds us that the Internet and the browser will likely be a blip in the greater effort of technical advancement. 
<p>
 Paul Soullelis questioned where slowness is the more rare attribute.
