title: The Web Inspector as Design Tool
author: John Caserta
description: I have been using the Web Inspector within the browser for the last couple years to make adjustments to designs. Designing patterns is perhaps the simplest way to make this process clear. Whereas a dialog box might be needed to make global adjustments in Illustrator, altering margins or border width in the browser can provide immediate access to a multitude of ideas. And although adjusting numbers in the browser's Web Inspector is quantitative, it is more identical to collage than WYSIWYG design methods. The following patterns are the result of this play and the inspiration for the greater project: the web environment as a tool to produce designs of any sort, like this book.
