		David Reinfurt recently mounted a show at the Columbia University on the work of Muriel Cooper at MIT. Here is a link to the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-caserta-1">audio of the interview.</a>
</section>


<p class="interview-q">I&rsquo;m John Caserta Department Head and Assistant Professor at RISD and we are here in New York with Christina Webb and Kelly Walters. We&rsquo;re here to talk a little bit about the web in particular but first maybe we can get an update from david about his practice and how you define your practice and what that looks like currently.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Okay, well, I work in several different ways and under different names, but principally I work as <a href="http://dextersinister.org">Dexter Sinister</a> with Stuart Bailey my partner. We have worked together for about seven or eight years I think at this point. Stuart lives right now in Liverpool. When we first started working together he lived in New York although he only lived half time in New York at that point and he lived in Los Angeles for about five years and now he is back in England. So anyway. Before I did that I had an independent practice called <a href="http://o-r-g.com">ORG</a> which was principally myself and other assistants and collaborators as necessary. When I stopped doing that and started doing Dexter Sinister I got rid of ever having any help because I decided that wasn&rsquo;t for me. I just wanted to be sitting down doing the work. I have taught since finishing graduate school consistantly. That feeds the work I do. Usually I try to make the two things to sync and when things are working right they do. So you are kind of doing the same assignment with the students that you are also thinking about in your work. I think this is a great thing and this is the only way that teaching makes sense for me. It takes a bit of will to do that as well. I do prinicpally graphic design and the projects end up being not necessary typical graphic design projects. It has always been that way since I finished at Yale in &lsquo;99 and started ORG. I worked in graphic design before that and decided I didn&rsquo;t want to have such a straight-forward graphic design practice and through persistence and kind of saying what you do a lot of times then people start to understand or give you opportunities to do that. I mean the other thing I think was pretty explicit about in the beginning was <mark>I&rsquo;m not going to do one thing for money and one thing for art, I just think that is a dead end so whatever I&rsquo;m doing , I&rsquo;m doing and I make sure the two things align and you make arrangements and affordances and all sorts of ways to make that happen</mark>. It&rsquo;s taken awhile for it to really be plausible but each place, so whether you have really inexpensive rent or you do this that or the other but I never bought the idea that I&rsquo;m going to do this one job and it&rsquo;s going to pay me a lot of money and I&rsquo;m going to do this other things that are low paying. So I never do low paying work and I neither do I fool myself with the other and I think both those things are important so I say no to a lot of things that sound great but they say I don&rsquo;t have the money I don&rsquo;t have the money and they are not going to take it seriously and it leads to all sorts of problems so just make sure these things are taken care of. I always think it&rsquo;s super important to as well reflect that in the way you work with other people. I never do anything, you know, you don&rsquo;t do anything at a reduced rate and you don&rsquo;t ask anybody else to do that either. I think that&rsquo;s really important.</p>

<p class="interview-q">So much of what you do is self-generated particularly going back to <a href="http://www.dot-dot-dot.us/"><em>Dot Dot Dot</em></a> with the writing and the output and the custom typography like really owning all parts of the project but having so much of that coming from you or your colleagues. I&rsquo;m curious how the transition from <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> to the <a href="http://servinglibrary.org">Serving Library</a> occurred and that side of you that does not require the commissioner or perhaps that comes later or some how get works out at your full steam but the idea of the publishing component is one thing I think is particularly important about us to talk about today.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Well let&rsquo;s see. It&rsquo;s funny things like either with <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> or with Bulletins of the Serving Library which follows from it. It doesn&rsquo;t seem very different than any other job and this maybe has something with the fact that it has kind of a name and trajectory on its own you know. So there are more people involved in it so there are certain things those publications do that aren&rsquo;t necessarily what I do or what Stuart does or in the case of Bulletins that what Stuart, Angie Keefer or I do. You know it&rsquo;s kind of got its own head of steam in that people contributing to it etc. etc. so it never feels that self generated. It&rsquo;s funny it&rsquo;s just a different kind of process and it&rsquo;s the same thing with the publication, always what it&rsquo;s about is typically what a lot of what I want to be thinking about at that time anyway or what I happened to be thinking about or what Stuart happens to be thinking about or what Angie happens to be thinking about; and so it&rsquo;s just to say I suppose it&rsquo;s self generated but you are always asking other people to do it you know you are asking someone else to write about this that or the other and it comes out of conversations you have already had with them and so it feels like you are kind of beholden to them to keep up your side of the deal like edit it well or engage or you know be rigorous with it etc. So it never feels like you are just doing it for yourself because you&rsquo;re not. As soon as you get into it you got like ten more obligations which is great, but it&rsquo;s not different than a job.</p>
<p class="interview-q">It&rsquo;s more like you&rsquo;ve created a platform or area of conversation that you are maintaining or helping to maintain but you are really relying on others to put in or contribute.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah it&rsquo;s funny, yes. But then it feels like a graphic design job at the end of the day. In a good way. Like in a good way because you are collecting that material and you&rsquo;re more involved in the editing and soliciting it but you are basically producing it. You are putting it into a form and so it&rsquo;s funny, nothing ever happens about that. We take a pretty firm hand in editing not to say we make it exactly how it is just to say the articles that go in there often come out of conversations we have with whomever is writing it and sometimes it is as simple as we want to know more about that and we ask somebody would you think about writing this and then you have that conversation so it&rsquo;s kind of very different than when we stopped <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> and started <em>The Serving Library</em> because of its name. It&rsquo;s a library and it sounds like these people assumed it was a bit more of an open scenario but <mark>it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s really like a totally custom niche journal of a small constellation of concerns between the three of us editors and the group of people who were willing to read it you know the other people were willing to contribute to.</mark></p>
<p class="interview-q">How did the form of it come about? I mean the idea of the PDF that essentially builds to a volume that is tied to something. That in and of itself is interesting way of publishing.</p>
<p class="interview-a">That seems pretty relevant to the class. Stuart started <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> with Peter Bilak and a third person although the third one kind of faded away before the first issue but Peter and Stuart did the first ten issues of <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> and did it in the Netherlands. Peter kind of faded out a bit I think towards the end of that time and Stuart moved to NY right before issue ten and we started working together. I had already been writing and we&rsquo;d had a dialogue ever since I finished graduate school at the same time he did. We were constantly looking for ways to work together and we started doing it together from issue 11 to 20 and did that for awhile and it would connect whatever projects we were doing and connect to lots of things. At the end of number 20 it built up a head of steam in certain areas and then we felt like it&rsquo;s kind of scattered each time and it completely fit how we thought about those things but it seemed too easy, it just feels like another one. Maybe it&rsquo;s too easy and so we thought that would be a good idea to not get comfortable, to break it in order to think about it again. <mark>I may have done that often times just trying to unsettle yourself. I  think we all do that to some degree.</mark> Anyway with Bulletins of the Serving Library we decided to stop doing <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> at number 20. Just cut it off and reinvent it as this other publication, Bulletins of the Serving Library, and take whatever seemed to be the distinguishing qualities of <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> and do the opposite. So we decided this one to not just to be this willful about it but just to see what that was like because of course if we&rsquo;re still doing it, it&rsquo;s not going to be that different. So we never themed <em>Dot Dot Dot</em>, it was kind of explicitly anti-theme so we thought okay so these issues will be themed that was one thing we thought and another thing we thought was, it&rsquo;s kind of absurd printing this thing and distributing it in the light of all the changes with electronic publishing and it&rsquo;s worthwhile thinking about that. We always felt that how <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> is made is also very much part of the equation. It&rsquo;s like being graphic designers of course we are interested in the form doing a lot of the work and in <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> that often happened with the writing and the typesetting, the layout, whatever. But with this we wanted to rethink how somebody actually gets the things and have that do some of the work as well and so we thought that it&rsquo;d be nice to reconsider it. Well we started doing it with Dexter Sinister. We&rsquo;d started a library part of our website that was just PDFs that sit on part of the website and it was kind of a back door of the website. It just had PDF&rsquo;s of things we liked or had written or other people had written and would be found and put on there and it was definitely a curated set of these things. We lavished time over designing the front covers. So it wasn&rsquo;t a comprehensive PDF library it was a very specific collection of things and we just kind of put them up with some degree of concertedness. So we&rsquo;d been doing that and we were like, wow this has really built up to something we like so when we thought of reinventing <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> we were like well it might be nice to consider it around themes and have the text have some discreteness so that each one can stand on its own and that it would be somehow electronic. So we thought that we would just offer each article as PDF and as a PDF specifically rather than a kind of text on a screen for again the kind of weird slightly out of place quality that a PDF would have on the internet because you can&rsquo;t search it and index it. <mark>And so we liked it being electronic and really easy to distribute and that it maintained some sense of objecthood.</mark> It felt like a thing and it was walled off from other things although it was important in the way it related to other things but it was done and finished in a thing and that&rsquo;s different than the way things typically worked on the web. So we thought of that first, that the articles would just be PDFs and we would serve them up through a website. Then we thought, well we aren&rsquo;t ready to not print it, either. We thought it was much better in the same way to print it just to trouble out the distinction between those things in how they work. So the way that it currently works is we work in six month cycles of an issue based around a theme that we commision text and edit them and typeset them and whatever and then offer them up on the website <a href="http://servinglibrary.org">serving library.org</a> for download. Then at the end of the 6 months we collect them together into a printed issue and we also reconsidered the printing part of it and how it works so we print half the run of the copies in the United States and half the run in Europe. In the U.S., we print and distribute ourselves, like we completely do the whole thing ourselves and we deal with subscriptions and wholesale and everything. And then on the Euro side, we have a publisher who just does it and just gives us very little money back but takes care of everything. Printing at Sternberg Press in Berlin which we worked with a bunch at that point and so Sternberg prints it, distributes it, does everything. And great, it gets distributed in Europe more widely as a result because we are not as good distributors. But we also don&rsquo;t make any money on it you know but here we make money on it so that kind of thing we don&rsquo;t make much money on it but we make some money on it and that way feeds other &hellip;</p>
<p class="interview-q">You make no money when someone downloads a PDF</p>
<p class="interview-a">Right, exactly we make no money on it but it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p class="interview-q">Well but it&rsquo;s fun to talk shop with you because you are very hands on and are clearly making everything you do and you&rsquo;re very ingrained in it and I think that there is a tendency for that kind of conversation to get lost or it&rsquo;s very abstract but in the case of our interest here as a group and what you&rsquo;re working on so I imagine you&rsquo;re producing the bulletins in InDesign or in some way. Is that something that you&rsquo;ve played with? Other ways of making publications in any of your work? Is there anything about the bulletins project or anything that you&rsquo;re doing or your work with studying Muriel Cooper that questions the design tool? </p>
<p class="interview-a">For sure it is. When we are designing the format of the Bulletins of the Serving Library we also kind of worked the other way from <em>Dot Dot Dot</em> which we decided would be templated and absolutely regular and like <em>October Journal</em> as our model. We actually went and found the <em>October</em> printer and insisted that they print it, etc., but so also the templated logic seemed something that was much more native to an electronic environment and so when doing that, sure, we thought about first how do you more automatically pour it into the format. <mark>When we designed it as well we designed it first to be read on the screen and second to be [read in print] so that it had to work in both situations so it is a little bit big in print and it is a little bit small on the screen but we liked the idea of it just having it broker those differences and compromise and not be two different things just because we thought it would be more specific as a result.</mark></p>
<p class="interview-q c">interesting that is a little bit off too one way or the other not just settling into just one.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Exactly, we said that the electronic part, we were going to privilege that. That was how we are going to make our decisions but that it had to work in both ways, you know, just like a typical design problem. You can&rsquo;t just throw your hands up and say well it doesn&rsquo;t do that. You know it has to answer all the things that it needs to answer. But when doing it, we thought about the tools and I don&rsquo;t know of a better way to do it at the moment that seems compelling. It&rsquo;s not where we have put our effort and I think it&rsquo;s primarily to do with setting the thing as pages in InDesign is the simplest way and is the most practical way for us deal with them but we kind of worked backwards. We worked backwards because then we can work PDFs from them and of course we can put links in them and do other things but there is something that, I mean, we have rethought other parts of the tool in other words. When the PDFs are produced, they get time stamped and so on the website there is a timestamp in the printed journal as well as down on the bottom corner and it&rsquo;s on every page when the last file was touched and on the website it&rsquo;s whenever you download it. <mark>We really liked teasing out that distinction that the publishing act when you get it from a website is that act of downloading it. You&rsquo;ve made a copy and that&rsquo;s the thing that I really like about PDF for example, but it&rsquo;s also the same as sending email.</mark> As soon as you do it, it makes electronic everything you ask for. So you&rsquo;re by de-facto publishing, you&rsquo;re reproducing it.</p>
<p class="interview-q">The server has the original.</p>
<p class="interview-a">The server has the original and it&rsquo;s just printing out things as you need them and the same thing when you send an email it&rsquo;s leaving its little bits on every server it touches on the way.</p>
<p class="interview-q">So there&rsquo;s this term which is so prevalent now, responsive design, which you can date back to this idea of the database or the data source or this idea of the server as having the content and the content can go wherever it needs to go which has huge implications on design because it puts us into a systems mentality where we sort of need to make sure content modules will work on, if we&rsquo;re thinking in practical land, I mean phones, ipads, laptops, huge machines and in print, conceivably, as an extension of that. In thinking about your commissioned work or leave that work aside, your work that does involve the web, how are you dealing with that as a designer in terms of even delivering on multiple electronic formats and how is that working for you given your pension for detail and control?</p>
<p class="interview-a">I mean you are always trying to figure out the best way to do it and also <mark>I tend to design a good distance back from the leading edge. But there are reasons for this. It&rsquo;s not just to be cute or do anything else I think if it&rsquo;s not quite in sync with what everyone else is doing it has more of a chance of working, causing someone to pause and think about it which is what I would want to happen.</mark> And so one way to do that is to be not quite up to date. There are plenty of other ways to do that. You can do that with rupturous graphic design form, you know you can do that lots of ways with the way that you make the tools that you use to make the things. How you talk about it is another way that can elicit that reaction. But the bonus in doing it a little bit out of time and not necessarily like some set distance I mean sometimes it is absolutely at the cutting edge or sometimes it is beyond that. Its just not accepting the immediate leading qualities of what should be &hellip;</p>
<p class="interview-q k">&hellip; happening right now? Yeah like what&rsquo;s happening currently</p>
<p class="interview-a">And so but also when you work a little bit backwards you can see some and as long as you&rsquo;re not abdicating the responsibility to look at what&rsquo;s going on right now then if you work a little bit backwards than you can also see some of the things that weren&rsquo;t done then and follow and choose an alternate route. You know the technology has caught up so you can do something different so that&rsquo;s like &hellip; for example &hellip; <mark>I&rsquo;m working on a website right now which looks really super super which at the moment looks like it could have been done in 1997 perhaps but it&rsquo;s made you know it&rsquo;s made in a way it&rsquo;s completely over-engineered, absolutely over-engineered.</mark> It&rsquo;s for a client in San Francisco and they are very they have significant technical support and so I love the idea that it is absolutely cutting edge but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it. So it is just but then you try to figure out ways that the two things can clash meaningfully and that and if you can figure that out it&rsquo;s interesting. Wading through the technical deep waters of making in this other way and that.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Yeah like the quote un quote the back end or where the data is is something you have always worked with and done intelligently in terms of being able to access data, query data even the org home page looks like it&rsquo;s a mix between 1995 but also somehow today always. there is always that variable of today which sort of works. It sort of like times new roman lets get it on a grey background instead of a white background instead of the blue. But yeah this idea of in an educational environment which you are also are in constantly is how do we make knowledge, expectations of students and users and society around you know tools in fact if we just keep it on kind of the tools level what kind of tools do we use and how to we interrogate them in ways that are interesting and potentially speculative advanced even ahead of the time but yet also acknowledge kind of what they were made for so I means it&rsquo;s something we are always playing with um and so I think some of the questions come from that place like how to actually so by not using InDesign for us it&rsquo;s a way of actually I put out at the beginning of the class, is we are actually rethinking the browser itself as the delivery mechanism by actually lopping it off for a few months,  not thinking about it as a user interface assignment or project you know it&rsquo;s that actually you&rsquo;re using the browser as a tool to generate anything in the world because it is actually pretty developed tool. It&rsquo;s way more advance than most things as far as creating design. So Muriel Cooper is an inspiration for and Bethany talked about wanting to study under her and going to RISD instead so her name comes up in the north east occasionally but I loved the show you put together and maybe we can talk a little about that and sort of how that influences you and sort of how you ended up looking into her work and what does it mean for your practice in addition to fueling you?</p>
<p class="interview-a">Well I can describe how I got interested in the first place. Which was I think in 94. I was in NY and working at 212 Associates here. I had graduated from UNC, John was there also, and I moved to NY and intended to study graphic design where I can go to graduate school enrolled at Pratt and didn&rsquo;t like it. It didn&rsquo;t seem like a good use of time so I dropped out really quickly and ended up kind of finding my way into getting a graphic design job and I don&rsquo;t need to backtrack this far but anyway. Working at 212 Associates. So I got a job there because I could run Photoshop anywhere while I&rsquo;m there also they got a job to design Reuters&rsquo; website, Reuters first website, and I was like, hey I think I can do that. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing but I managed to work on that and through that I got I thought well maybe I should go back to school and I thought I would go to MIT to the Media Lab and to the Visible Language Workshop because I had heard of it and it seemed oh that seems really cool. So I arranged a visit up there and so it was like, I guess that was in the visit was at the very end of 1994, I went up there and Muriel had only recently passed away but one of her students Lisa Strausfeld who was there took, showed me around a little bit I got very excited about it and I kind of then began looking into Muriel&rsquo;s work a bit more to understand that, although I didn&rsquo;t even realize what the story was and right after that I got a job out in SF at IDEO doing interaction design, there wasn&rsquo;t a thing hardly called interaction design, but I was working for a former Media Lab person and she actually was not at the VLW but her working partner was at the VLW and Muriel student about that time muriel had just done a TED talk about a year earlier in Monterey where she showed new computer interface work. Her work was kind of everywhere at this point, about 1995, I just assumed it would be everywhere and like doing interaction design then like that was one of the principle references and all the people at IDEO knew that work and I stopped paying attention for a while, I went back to graduate school and stopped paying attention to that stuff very much and just assumed everybody else would have followed it all the way and I guess afterwards I guess like 2004 or 2005 I started doing some work for MIT and stumbled back into her work and thought wow this is amazing and started tracking it and researching it put together a talk and got there that way. Thats kind of the long story.</p>
<p class="interview-q">It&rsquo;s one of those moments &hellip; she predated John Maeda. I feel like he maybe was brought in after she passed away and Lisa was out in SF during that period too, right?</p>
<p class="interview-a">Lisa was, yeah she had just moved out.</p>
<p class="interview-q">But yeah so I&rsquo;m wondering, the show thats up what are some of the themes you are hoping to impart or what would you say is sort of the curatorial zest?</p>
<p class="interview-a">You know it&rsquo;s funny, responsive is sort of the thing. But it&rsquo;s a different meaning of the word responsive, or maybe it&rsquo;s not actually. The thing that I have found, the thing that I find really compelling about her work is well there are a couple of things, one of which <mark>I think the most exciting thing about the work is that she was always treating the present moment as if was like two years later. Not in a blue sky research kind of environment way but in a very practical way like oh this computer should be able to do that and so I&rsquo;m going to make it do that in some limited way.</mark> Or this book should we should really be able to &hellip; An example is she was working at MIT Press as the first design director there. And it was the beginning of the 1970s, the end of the 1960s. At the time phototypesetting was how books would be laid out. You would mark up the manuscript send it out and the type house would send you back galleys and then you&rsquo;d lay it out, you&rsquo;d paste it up and put together the book and then there would be corrections and you&rsquo;d have to send out for type again wait a couple days get it back and do this kind of thing. And she thought that was a waste of time and it wasn&rsquo;t responsive enough. It had consequences because each time you sent out for new type you couldn&rsquo;t change the, because the process was slower you couldn&rsquo;t adjust your design in a way that was quick enough. She&rsquo;s walking around tv, like video just coming like you know like Portapak video just coming out computers at MIT like she was one of her very close friends was Nicholas Negroponte starting an architecture machine group there then at the time. and so she was thinking well these books are too damn slow you know it&rsquo;s so frustrating you got to send out for the type and get it back and plus were making so many books at MIT Press at this point that there is no way to really deal with them all. So she just said okay I imagine that these things should happen faster and they are going to happen faster and she kind of like picked up, you know, invented ways  for that to happen which is really cool. IBM Selectric typewriters were around and like IBM composers which is like a typewriter with memory basically and so she convinced MIT Press to get a little battery of these typewriters and to typeset some of the books in house that way and so she would they had a battery of people typing on typewriters in the basement like a small battery of people typing on typewriters in the basement some of the books they produced completely just typesetting all of the copy. I mean typewriting all of the copy. and the result, but done with a graphic designers eye. these are amazing they are really stunning publications and they could happen more quickly. You just kind of use what was at hand rather than kind of inventing some high tech solution and the result was that you could jsut get changes downstairs that afternoon. And the run on result is then it cost less money and I think that is the super importnat part, is that it cost less money and then you can as well she developed systems for like jobbing out the covers for these things to designers, she had a little network of designers she liked. you know she could just say do this cover and it&rsquo;s gonna there is always a set rate and it pays this much and you do this and then you turn it in and thats done. Then it&rsquo;s not kind of endless hand wringing over each job. It&rsquo;s a real system that is also in line with the way they are publishing. but it&rsquo;s something that follows the logic much more of the like a computerized publication system but it was before computers existed but I mean before computers were applicable in that situation and so it was um it was treating that moment as if it was 5 years later and she did that all the time. With all the work that she did she was I mean at MIT Press she set up a little research center within the press to and brought in a computer for example and a color photocopier like a color photocopier and started making things that way as well. they weren&rsquo;t necessarily, they didn&rsquo;t always see the light of day but uh but you know it was not like research for the sake of research it was absolutely pragmatic and then kind of using the absurd results to generate new form and new ideas. and she did the same kind of thing when she got when she set up her the visual language workshop. it was a printing and teaching workshop within the architecture school um which mixed regular offset printing with also computers and new software and all sorts of things and even when she was age 50 and already a very well established graphic designer she stopped doing print completely and just dove into computer interfaces and started the and cofounded the media lab with Negroponte and Seymour Papert and a couple others and um started just doing computer graphics and yet she didn&rsquo;t know how to program she always wanted to learn how to program it just never quite worked for her but she could understand the logic of it and she could make the things do what she wanted to do in some way or the other. you know so it&rsquo;s just like treating one, I think that is the thing that is inspiring, like she was always looking for ways to make the things she was working with more responsive but not for the sake of them being faster and cheaper. but more for the sake of allowing her time to rethink and iterate the design and it be a more kind of fluid process.</p>
<p class="interview-q">It speaks to process as much as technology.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah it&rsquo;s definitely like a she was fascinated with technology in all of its forms but uh but it was this real kind of really, I mean what&rsquo;s cool about it I think is that it&rsquo;s kind of gritty engagement with all the details of how you actually make it it&rsquo;s not like the designer just gets to, it&rsquo;s not research that just imagines future scenarios for how these things work it&rsquo;s actually like applied to the project at hand and sometimes really awkwardly I think, I think thats cool too.</p>
<p class="interview-q">So what is your current relationship to the computer or technology in terms of how you make things and are you still writing software and what, what, why?</p>
<p class="interview-a">Thats a good question. Yes would be the first part.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Does that feel like an essential part of your work. I mean it&rsquo;s sort of is it how does that fit it.</p>
<p class="interview-a">So I do computer programming whenever I get the chance basically. like anytime I get a chance and sometimes it&rsquo;s really really overkill, like it&rsquo;s not what I need to be doing but uh it&rsquo;s I think the most creative act for me because I can why is that the case. Its something I enjoy, a, and then I think the things that result out of it are usually surprising to me and I like that and I like just thinking through computer programing I suppose because I see how relevant it is everywhere I look and to just understand how the thing really works and then to mine it for metaphors. so it&rsquo;s like object oriented programming so then how does that make you think differently about everything else. or you know the fact that a server runs and dishes out things then how do you extract that idea and think about other things from it so it&rsquo;s kind of a conceptual tool but it&rsquo;s also one that I actually enjoy doing. although I think uh yeah sometimes it&rsquo;s kind of willful, people say you should just use these existing frameworks or whatever it might be. or you hire a programmer to do this. I&rsquo;ve organized the way I work where I don&rsquo;t, that it is still possible to do the programming myself. Its not like it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s not it doesn&rsquo;t scale.</p>
<p class="interview-q">What languages are you writing in and how does that play into networks or end users and what languages?</p>
<p class="interview-a">Usually it&rsquo;s a complete mix of lots of things and often it&rsquo;s kind of per project. for example when I&rsquo;m making websites I&rsquo;m using PHP and javascript like I think many many people do at the moment, or html as well. and thats all pretty straightforward and standard. I like PHP because it&rsquo;s logically consistent and it runs the server side. javascript I was a little bit slower to come to because it was a mess but it&rsquo;s so easy these days that thats fine. I mean I&rsquo;ll use whatever is at hand, I did a project which is kind of still ongoing involving rehabilitating metafont, a program from 1979, and this thing, and in order to do this it&rsquo;s this total pile up of languages. it&rsquo;s like bash scripting on top of python on top of whatever. languages that don&rsquo;t exist anymore, web is one, called web. But it&rsquo;s lovely it&rsquo;s just like this complete mix so I quite enjoy those things.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Thats the font you can change like the slanted, there is like three axis. yeah there is a serving library piece about that.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah there is, and now it runs as a stand alone always changing typeface. it was super involved to make.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Is is something that is quote unquote complete or usable now?</p>
<p class="interview-a">It is usable to kind of generate things. the problem is it would run directly on your system like constantly changing itself in indesign except for the system doesn&rsquo;t pull, there is something lower in the system that doesn&rsquo;t allow it to update as quickly as I would like it too which is fine. Its kind of a complete tool at this point. we use it for animated things like this which is. thats a good, that thing is a mess of languages and whatever but I think that is probably what I also like about it and the result is basically like you are in 1979. Hehehe. With some modern affordances to it you can output nice quicktimes and make like a piece of software that runs on its own.</p>
<p class="interview-q">You get the time machine like quality from it?</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah exactly.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Do you all have thoughts, kelly and christina, we probably have about 5 or 10 minutes just given life schedule.</p>
<p class="interview-q k">I was just going to ask things you found difficult and I know you were just talking about the changes in the browser and how that kind of influences your process and how it&rsquo;s been altered or modified in that way. I&rsquo;m just curious how thats kind of affected you and your work.</p>
<p class="interview-a">I think it&rsquo;s gotten better. Its gotten more predictable like ten years ago it was a total fucking nightmare working with internet explorer they all had such proprietary ideas about webpage should go together and how that has kind of solidified and how that&rsquo;s not surprising I guess. but it&rsquo;s great because the other way was tedious and absolutely no fun.</p>
<p class="interview-q">It was like trains with different track widths. you would have to get off, you would have to move the cargo to a different, yeah it&rsquo;s just ridiculous.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah and it&rsquo;s really not interesting the broker those deals. So when it worked okay it worked, but there was no other advantage. So I don&rsquo;t know now they work so nicely, generally, together that those changes I don&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t have as significant an impact and before I think I principally ignored them by working to a lower common denominator and now I feel like I can work out at the edge of it. Use some whatever safari things it only does or chrome only does or whatever and it&rsquo;s fine because you can figure out ways it works for people that don&rsquo;t have that also without too much difficulty and it&rsquo;s not just chasing your tail to do although there is still plenty of that which is why web things are not my favorite. You know like HTML and CSS is just not that, I mean it can&rsquo;t it can do a lot of course but there are things that are limiting about it, or not limiting just tedious about it.</p>
<p class="interview-q k">Yeah I mean I feel that way too just in terms of just again I&rsquo;m familiar with HTML and CSS and so this semester I even branched into learning javascript and jquery and that whole world which is like foreign to me even. And so it&rsquo;s interesting to kind of um be immersed in something that has always existed, I shouldn&rsquo;t say always existed, but it has in terms of like the internet and what I&rsquo;m seen on the front end but not necessarily know what&rsquo;s happening in the back and like how the activity and interactivity is happening within all the like graphics that you are seeing. and so it&rsquo;s just interesting to kind of have that influence my process this semester even and how your work can change based on all of that and how much information you need to know in order to kind of use the languages in an interesting way.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Its kind of like, if you know about how they work like your describing it helps you conceptualize not just what&rsquo;s possible but like what&rsquo;s appropriate or what feels native, you know, I think thats a good thing to.</p>
<p class="interview-q k">Yeah because in some ways it&rsquo;s like I want to be able to do these things but then it&rsquo;s almost like your conceptual thinking has to shift in terms of the functionality of what you are using in the actual tool that it is and being able to have that kind of be at the same place in order to kind of make in a really interesting way.</p>
<p class="interview-q">It&rsquo;s like designing for printing as well. that sort of knowing how printing work or presses work, getting used to that.</p>
<p class="interview-a">But it&rsquo;s like thinking how the books get sold, and how the things get. it&rsquo;s funny like yeah. I think just understanding just a little bit of that or I wish that when you are learning any of that it&rsquo;d be really useful to just understand the most basic idea of how a server works and how headers work and html you know. It sends headers first, the headers determine how it&rsquo;s going to interpret what follows and etc and you don&rsquo;t ever get that because it&rsquo;s like dreamweaver you learn by doing dreamweaver or something and you know it&rsquo;s like oh you&rsquo;re screwed because if you know the first part then you can think about it differently. If you know you can change everything by having the header do something funny.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Well you can jump straight to the end form. I want it to look like this thing and you sort of miss all that other stuff. Yeah it&rsquo;s true. I mean I sort have taken to CSS, CSS has these constant developments that make it sort of do more but then there is also more ways to sort of undo them at the same time or use them for conceptual means. So I find that there is something satisfying about it because it&rsquo;s still this sort of clunky boxy world the web and you sort of kind of work with that. Its almost like lead type.</p>
<p class="interview-q c">Something I was wondering is actually going back to talking about your practice and how you decided to work and um when you were talking about being you know coming up on the way you wanted to work and being insistent about it and then doing that until it became plausible. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that and what it means and how you came to work the way you do.</p>
<p class="interview-a">I mean for me it was just after graduate school I knew I wanted to work for myself and that was kind of the reason to go to graduate school as well. Yes, like john we could have just been doing our things and we would have had very comfortable lives and it would have been easy enough but you know you go back to school to trouble yourself, make everything more complicated which is great and pays other dividends of course. I knew when I finished school I&rsquo;m not going to work for somebody else you know you come out with a strong, head strong, and uh I was just like whatever I&rsquo;m going to do I&rsquo;m going to figure out a way to work on my own so anyway I knew to start with teaching would give me a regular job on occasion although it paid shit and in the end jobs are important and uh but and then I knew enough, I had friends from working in graphic design in new york who would like toss me things or ask me to work on something with them because I could do web things and that was kind of good so I would work with a couple friends who had small actually two different friends who both were husband and wife and had companies together and we would do some things together and those were always nice and there were people I&rsquo;d worked with before like somebody I&rsquo;d worked with at IDEO and somebody I&rsquo;d worked with at 212 so I kind of, so our sensibilities matched so that was really good. and uh yeah and I took a first I was working out of my apartment of course. you know it was really tiny. like a room this size on 22nd street, you know it was horrible. and then things, you know you kind of also have to make jumps before you are ready to make jumps. so I got a studio and I was like oh shit and you know it&rsquo;s that kind of self you know there is a bit of you say what you it&rsquo;s a bit of you have to announce that you are in the game in order for people to it kind of by getting a studio and announcing that you&rsquo;re going and people start to take you more seriously and you get more work as well and you know not everything is a  good job you do some things and you&rsquo;re like okay I&rsquo;m never doing that again. you know which is you figure out what fits and as long as you are clear about that. so you know when I&rsquo;m saying plausible I just mean when it&rsquo;s not like I wasn&rsquo;t ripping my hair out at the end of the day because I&rsquo;m working like crazy and I can&rsquo;t pay rent and I can&rsquo;t do this which about 5 years in I was like that pretty significantly it&rsquo;s just like oh this is horrendous. but there are good days and there are bad days and ah it&rsquo;s not just like a progress story either you know it&rsquo;s like you um I think just by you know it takes a good bit of certainly like a self you know doggedness just persistence so I just had the same idea that I wanted to work in a certain way and you try to see it&rsquo;s all a balancing act to try to see what you can rearrange to make that happen and you let people know that is how you work and you&rsquo;re not going to do somethign else. and that yeah.</p>
<p class="interview-q c">Figure out how to make that sustainable.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah you figure out how to make it sustainable but it kind of you know you get a little clue each step along the way and it&rsquo;s different for different people. you know. and there is certainly no secret to it nor any moment when it did become plausible because it always was. I was always able to live in NY and thats expensive and thats expensive and you know it has never been a giant hardship I&rsquo;ve never but I think part of that is really um yeah just being insistent on that being the case and not taking the short route you know. along the way sure I got offered jobs that paid tons of money and seemed like that could be great for this reason but you realise no maybe it&rsquo;s not the best idea and uh sometime you take them and thats not the best idea and sometimes you take them and oh it&rsquo;s wonderful it&rsquo;s great I did a job like that and it worked out really beautifully and I was really happy it worked out you just never know.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Models. Maybe ending with this idea of different models for practice and like is there anything out there that is intriguing to you that doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not a good fit for you but you might see as like a different way that our profession can move forward other than this idea of the firm. I know there was that piece you had in dot dot dot whether you would have an addendum to that piece and sort of this day and age.</p>
<p class="interview-a">I mean I think you know people who may think we all increasingly work in little bands that work on different projects together that&rsquo;s typically the way everybody who is working right now. But I think it&rsquo;s not great for me but I like these kind of entrepreneurial kind of .com models of places that set up labs or whatever. I mean that&rsquo;s interesting to me for sure because you have much more stake in the game and uh I mean uh I think product designers talk about having a stake in the royalties of the product or architects are funding their own projects you know and becoming a developer in the meantime all those things are super interesting to me. Like I can&rsquo;t quite do it but I wish I could.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Like the financial stake.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah you put money into it and it&rsquo;s a speculative venture. It&rsquo;s that simple. But it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t quite know how to do it although I would love to do it. I think that&rsquo;s a way forward and I think there are firms doing that like Lust and they have Lust Labs and thomas and Jeroen have been very excited about this and very uh and you know and I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s really quite worked but it definitely feeds the other work.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Does it work sort of on a commision basis at the end of the day. Like you are trying to generate something that is then paid for by someone else or what is the financial model?</p>
<p class="interview-a">No they don&rsquo;t. I think the financial model for them well I don&rsquo;t exactly know but I suspect it&rsquo;s kind of paid for by their other work. But that is actually no different than the way they have already worked and that is why I like them a lot because they just constantly make nonsense along with their other work and it&rsquo;s all the same for the jobs or for you know they produce a lot of things and they&rsquo;re they don&rsquo;t there is a lot of ancillary material and I think that becomes a home for it. you know like things that fall out it. I think that is a really nice, that&rsquo;s a model I can see being a good model, I just haven&rsquo;t seen it work.</p>
<p class="interview-q">Feels sort of like maybe like Muriel Cooper. It&rsquo;s sort of like a speculative model or you&rsquo;re sort of generating what you feel like you want to generate without a context or what not.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah It is. I think it not being separate from other work like thats. and you know the distribution channels are more open now and there are other ways to do that. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to happen in a big way, well I&rsquo;ll say I think it will happen in a big way. Somebody will figure out how to do it well. but then it won&rsquo;t be graphic design it will just be like they are making a company. lots of people have done that.</p>
<p class="interview-q">yeah and we have been comfortable with having graphic design mean whatever it needs to mean and whatever it wants to be is fine. Well thanks so much for making time.</p>
<p class="interview-a">Sure</p>
<p class="interview-q">Yeah, you&rsquo;ve given me a lot to think about</p>
<p class="interview-a">Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Thank you for coming down here.</p>
