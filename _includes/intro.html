            <p class="mainintro">Live type, data-awareness, animation and user-interaction are just a few of the reasons why the web browser has become a satisfying place to generate graphic design &mdash; both experienced in and outside the browser. 

            The series of formal experiments and conversations explore the role of the browser as another possible tool for designers. This website is also viewable as a print-on-demand pocket-sized book (or pdf). The book prioritizes reading and documentation, the website is easy to access and friendly on all devices (until it breaks). All of our source code has been made available. <a href="about-intro/" class="noprinty">Read introduction</a>
