  <li>I find myself increasingly disdainful of the many palettes and constraints designed into the Adobe products. It's not really Adobe's fault. First it was Aldus Pagemaker, then QuarkXPress, and now Adobe InDesign. The conveniences are manifold, but with each tool comes opportunity and limitation. 
  </li>

   <li>My tool of choice for most any project -- posters, documents, and even books -- is the Web browser. The browser is not even a tool, really, it's the rendering engine that compiles text instructions.  </li>

   <li>The Web browser is an ideal development envi- ronment because it combines data awareness and interactivity with increasingly robust pre- sentation options. This one-time studio elective makes use of the Web browser as a design tool to create off-browser forms: event ephemera, wallpaper and textiles, publications and objects. </li>
