<section class="interview-intro">
		So my name is Kelly. I'm a graphic design grad here at RISD. Some of my interests that I've been looking and how its shaped my design practice has been looking at textile, and so looking to you in terms of inspiration as your background and curious to hear a little bit more about how you ended up here.
</section>

<p>
	I definitely had like a winding road. I don't even know how I got into textiles,well I know, but it definitely wasn't an A to B road. So in my undergrad I started as an industrial designer and I didn't enjoy the programs. I felt like it really wasn't loose enough for me, so I went into textiles and fashion but in Uraguay. The textiles teachers there were more influenced by theater and fashion. There were half artists, have designers. So when I finished undergrad I was totally done with textiles and fashion. It was then that I started working as an industrial designer for a couple of years. I also worked as a constume assistant and then did two years working as a graphic designer at that point becuase I was confused. I realized that I really liked printing and its an combination of all of my interests. Its between graphic design and textiles and industrial design...I've never been a traditional designer in a sense. And actually in my lecture I was talking about how being a South American / Latin American we kind of like make things work. I've been a specific kind of designer. I don't know, I've always enjoyed the space between all of those things. 


<p>
	I'm sorry if this is alot.
</p>

<p class="q">
	No this is great, I'm fascinated, keep going!
</p>

<p>
	I've always been someone who has been into science and art. Textiles has that kind of combination because you're using machines, you're using structure, its very logical and very technological also because you're using all of these components. Its how you balance the science with your expressive side. I think as a textile designer, you learn how to use different machinery that you can transcend to express your own language as a designer.
</p>




<p class="q">
	Question 2?
</p>
<p>
   My work deals alot with identity and coming to terms with South American and moving to the United States.
</p>

<p>
	If you think about textiles, we're always coding something. Its like you're coding the machines that you're using. Actually, computers developed from textile languages. The first computer was a Jacquard Loom. So we, as textile designers, are already used to this structure. You have a very logical structure, and then you add materials and color and that's your way of adding an expressive component to the mix.

</p>



<blockquote>
	For me coding is an analogy to any other textile processes. If you look at how someone programs a Jacquard loom or how someone programs a sewing machine, the techniques they are using are basically CNC driven. Instead of cutting, the machines work with yarn. This type of programming essentially uses just all ones and zeros. The origin of the ones and zeros came from the Jacquard Loom. The first computer started with perforated holes. Programming languages all started with textiles.

</p>

<p>
	Structure is actually very logical and there are things that you can do and things that you can't do. It is structure on its own. Weaving its a good example where, you have one yard on top and another on the bottom. This formation is basically like one and zero. Its already binary.

</p>

<p>
	People ask me alot about technology and how it influences textiles. Its not about innovation and its not about the machinery. Everything we do involves machines, so usually we try not to be gimcky about it. The conversation when its interesting is about what is the expressive way, or manufacturing way

When I find something interesting there is usually some kind of expressive quality to or some improvement in manufacturing or both of them together.
</p>

<p class="q">
	Have you ever explored HTML or coding online?
</p>

<p>
	Because I studied graphic design prior to becoming a texile designer, I learned HTML, Dreamweaver and did mainly web work for about 2 years. I learned how to code in Flash and it horrible and I hated it.I think working with coding and working with all of these more computational aspects is like learning how to learn. Because it always evolves and its always changing and you always have to learn to keep up with the changes.
</p>

<p class="q">
	How did you end up at Converse? How has you process evolved?
</p>


<p>
	I knew that I wanted to work in Innovation and I am a material designer. I am a textile designer but but I consider myself a material designer. Its a bit beyond the textile itself. I'm designing experiences and I think that might be my industrial design background, but I'm interested in the relationship of the material with the consumer. The experience that someone gets between the material and the end product.
</p>

<p class="q">
	How are you incorporating these techniques in your professional practice at the Material Innovation Department at Converse? 
</p>

<p>
	The thing with Converse, is that we have a really exciting projects. I'm basically working for creative people, so I can relate. Its very open. Its a fashion brand and its an iconic product. Its a heritage brand that has a personality. The spirit of the brand is a lot about hacking technology and humanizing technology. Converse shoes are never going to feel like spaceships. Because thats not what the brand is about. People have that special, very personal relationship with them. I use to work in the denim industry before and I feel the relationship that you have your converse shoes, especially the chuck taylors is kind of the same that you have with your jeans. That its something that ages and grows with you. Kid consumers are an example of how they continue to wear the shoes and duck tape them after they've fallen apart and break. Its very grungy, very young.
</p>


<p>
	Its been really nice because I've been able to maintain my spirit with how I relate to technology. Its become more of, how do I hack things, how do things become more human, even though its very technological, how do they become closer to you. Its more of an experience.
</p>

<p>
	All my work, as silkscreener as a printer and as a knitter, how can a print stop being a 2 dimensional thing. 
</p>

<p>
	I think that its also all about the processes and not getting stuck. And thinking about how they mean something too, right? As your making it just gets to a point where it just feels right and your making these things flow from one place to the other. And, does it make sense? Or is the gimick that outputs something that you can make something move? Thats definitely something that I've been thinking a lot about. I feel like the meaningful work comes from the reason behind using that process.
</p>


<p>
	There's something about textiles that makes you feel so comfortable because you're surrounded by them, yet sometimes coding feels so foreign.So as a designer exploring, how do you make sense of those two worlds. Why are you mixing those two things together? What are you getting out of it? These are the questions I keep asking myself all the time. If you keep on asking these questions and it still makes sense then you're going in the right direction.
</p>


<p class="q">
	What do you think the future of textile design will be like with the integration of these digital techniques?
</p>

<p>
	The computer is just another tool. Its just another machine. Its about how you use the tool to make it become personal again. Because it can become so generic and removed. The work can be done by minions.
</p>

<p>
	And I think that people are really craving for that. Becasue technology today is a given. I don't know thats my two cents on it.
