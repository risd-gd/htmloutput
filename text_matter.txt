Conversations and projects that explore the web browser as a general purpose design tool

INTRO
(should output differently in print than online)

The Web browser is an ideal tool for designers because it combines As the palettes and options increase in Adobe projects, the modern Web browser has more and more what designers need from a tool: data awareness and interactivity with increasingly robust presentation options. This website (book) collects a few months worth of conversations with practitioners in design and experiments with the browser to create off-browser forms: event ephemera, wallpaper and textiles, videos and a book. A book that in fact comes from this very website. A "responsive" website that at any point in its development could output to a LuLu-printable pdf. The book prioritizing reading and documentation, the website foregrounding its ability to update, many more images and links to live code downloads.
