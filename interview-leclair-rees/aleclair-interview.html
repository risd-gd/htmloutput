<p class="interview-q">In our class, we are using the browser as a rendering engine/tool. How do you interact with the browser in creating your work?</p>

<p class="interview-a">The most obvious thing about the browser is that the viewport isn't a fixed dimension. So, rather than designing for a fixed format like you would when designing a poster or a book, you're designing for a set of possible formats, some more likely than others. Your design is more of a probabilistic system in that way. You write a series of rules that define how the design will respond in different scenarios, but you can never fully predict all situations or see all states of your design at the same time.

Also, the content in a website is always changing so you have to leave some of the subjective decisions about layout and sequencing up to the browser or the user. At Project Projects, I worked with Adam Michaels and Rob Giampietro on a site for the philosopher/theorist Susan Buck-Morss that archives collections — what she calls constellations — of images around different areas of her research. The images are arranged in loose grid visual clusters according to a few simple rules that determine which images should be large, which should be small, and how the images should be arranged together. When I was working on this system, it was an interesting feedback process of tuning different variables until the output felt right, while at the same time still producing surprising results. </p>

<p class="interview-q">How does your process/approach change when working with different mediums?</a>

<p class="interview-a">When you’re working with a medium, you always have to take some time to understand what the qualities of that medium are. Your intention as a designer is like a vector and the medium can be a multiplier in some directions and not in others. In that sense, you sometimes hear people talking about a medium having a “grain."

But more interesting to me is thinking about the social qualities of various mediums: how things are distributed, how they’re encountered in the world, how they’re picked up and read. That's something that I think we should think about more. </p>

<p class="interview-q">What is the connection between the medium for which something is created and the tool that is used to create it? (How does the tool affect the result?)</p>

<p class="interview-a">I saw a talk that Erik van Blokland gave at the Cooper Union in New York — and this is another way of getting at what you asked in the last question — in this talk, Erik talked about the idea of toolspace vs. ideaspace, which is the idea that there’s a set of possibilities that a tool gives you — in other words, everything that you can do with that tool — and there’s a set of possibilities that you can imagine.

And those two spaces intersect in different ways when you’re working. Sometimes, your ideaspace is fully contained by your toolspace, in which case you might need to spend more time learning how to use a particular tool, exploring its limits. Other times, your ideaspace might be more expansive than your toolspace, in which case, you might want to try using a new tool or even build your own. 

I think the two things are constantly influencing each other. If you spend a lot of time getting proficient with a tool, I think the toolspace opens up and then starts to define your ideaspace to a certain extent. So one thing I like to do — switch up mediums — because it keeps your ideaspace open to more possibilities than the ones afforded by any particular tool.

It’s also exciting I think because it means that if you can create a new tool and put it into the world, you have the possibility of influencing people quite a lot if they use it.</p>

<p class="interview-q">About the Ether Press project — why did you choose Twitter as a source of content to translate into print, and what thought processes led to the formatting decisions in the book?</a>

<p class="interview-a">I like Twitter because it's ephemeral. One of the ideas that motivated Ether Press was the idea that a book (like a website actually) no longer had to be a fixed thing but could be something they is published only on demand when it's needed. So it made sense to use a source of material that was changing often. 

Ellen Lupton has said that a lot of self-publishing is publishing the self and so I also think it's nice to connect Ether Press as a publishing platform with an online platform that has such a low barrier to entry. 

The design of the book is heavily influenced by the work of Donald Knuth. He made a system, by now probably familiar to most graphic designers, called TeX which was a typesetting system that he designed and built to typeset the volumes he published of his own research. Ether Press uses an open-source variant of TeX called ConTeXt that has more control over typographic detail. The typeface is called Computer Modern and it's one of the typefaces generated by Knuth's METAFONT program which he built to generate typefaces for use in TeX. </a>
