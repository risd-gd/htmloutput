<p>This <span class="noprinty">website</span> <span class="printy">book</span> combines conversations with practicing designers with three months of experimental projects that use the web browser to create off-browser forms: event ephemera, wallpaper and textiles, videos and a book. <span class="printy">This book in your very hands was printed from a web browser. </span> <span class="printy">This website prints to a small paperback book.</span> A "responsive" website that at any point in its development  couldoutput to a pdf. </p>

<p>The two forms each offer something distinct, and complementary. The web version is search-indexible, and widely available. A book is an ideal place for designers to archive and present their work in a physical format. Unlike the web, the book is a final format. It cannot lose compatibility or functionality. It cannot be linked to, it cannot be updated, and it cannot be edited. It can be reprinted but each individual book is an archive of a specific time and state. <span class="printy">This one, for example, was generated at XX/XX/XXXX at XX:XX </span>.</p>

<p>Both website and book come from the same codebase. Shared with you from a <a href="http://#">Github repository</a>. </p>


<h2>Credits</h2>
HTML Output was produced in spring 2014 at Rhode Island School of Design within a Graphic Design elective with the same name. All projects and work remains the copyright of the student or interviewee. A limited run of 50 books was printed by RISD GD. Further copies available from LuLu.com/asdf

We would like to thank the many practitioners who agreed to be interviewed for the project. Interviews were edited for readability and length. All interviews were performed between Febuary and May, 2014.
