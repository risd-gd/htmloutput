<p>
Further along in the semester, I began to experiment with printing multiple web pages on a single sheet. In this project I explored the results of printing with overlay of color and transparency in mind. It was an opportunity to start thinking about whether the browser should mimic the look of overpinting on screen before printing or allow the user to gain more control by feeding a sheet through a printing multiple times to accomplish the same effect. Questions to conisider &mdash; was it apporpriate to adjust scale of the web page using the print dialog box or resize the browser window to make crops? What were the results for each pursuit?
