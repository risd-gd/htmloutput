    I returned to the patterns that many people had been making for this class&mdash;my kinetic patterns, Daniel's stock element creations, John's repeats, Catherine's typographic layerings. These outputs have felt the most digital-native to me, by playing with how the browser structures output to create novel forms in a scrolling environment.
    I went about trying to print these. &ldquo;print.js&rdquo; is a file that, in theory, you can simply put into the end of your head tag and <mark>it will create an @media print{} style sheet that translates your screen output into something printable</mark>.
</p>
<p>
    With it, one can easily specify paper output size that crops the pattern before printing.
</p>
<p>
    print.js works best in Safari<footnote>This is because Google Chrome has limited built-in paper size options and Firefox applies obnoxious user agent styles.</footnote>.
</p>

<p>
    There are some best practices for formatting:<br />
    1. All javascript must be in the head or external file. None in the body. Use jquery!<br />
    2. Put print.js at the very end of your head.<br />
    3. The outside div should be called either "wrapper" or "container," otherwise it will assume it is a structural div rather than big wrapper.<br />
    4. Structure goes body > "wrapper" > container divs > pattern divs. <br />
    5. Write your CSS in a <textarea class="snippet" data-mode="html"><style></textarea> tag rather than on a separate .css file. <br />
    6. REQUIRES <textarea class="snippet" data-mode="html"><!DOCTYPE HTML><textarea class="snippet" data-mode="html"> tag at beginning, to find page height. </textarea>
