    I returned to the patterns that many people had been making for this class&mdash;my kinetic patterns, Daniel's stock element creations, John's repeats, Catherine's typographic layerings. These outputs have felt the most digital-native to me, by playing with how the browser structures output to create novel forms in a scrolling environment.
    I went about trying to print these. &ldquo;print.js&rdquo; is a file that, in theory, you can simply put into the end of your head tag and <mark>it will create an @media print{} style sheet that translates your screen output into something printable</mark>.
</p>
<p>
    With it, one can easily specify paper output size that crops the pattern before printing.
</p>
<p>
    works best in Safari<footnote>This is because Google Chrome has limited built-in paper size options and Firefox applies obnoxious user agent styles.</footnote>.
