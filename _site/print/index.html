<div><span>Q:</span> In this class, we are dealing with certain areas of the browser as a tool, particularly as a production tool, while severing off the consumption or interactive side. What is the browser capable of? You can make things in it, you can also receive things in it. What is this browser thing? You work so much in it and your work seems mostly browser based in some capacity whether its serving someone a browser deliverable or not. How do you see it or use it in this dane age? </div>

<div>
<span>Dan:</span> In our studio, and definitely in my class which is called "Networks and Transactions," I'm focused on the opposite actually. Focused on the idea of the browser as the end of a network that's reaching out, and on HTML as not only a formatting language but also a HTTPS protocol that really is all about distribution. But I really think your class is great and I think that that varied distinction suggests the need for filling out the other side of that equation as well. I think browsers are rendering engines and they're increasingly powerful ones. More and more you can make anything in HTML and CSS, especially if you're not worried about legacy browsers and stuff like that. I also think that the inspector is an incredible tool for manipulating a design language and an interactive language. Are we talking about the browser just as a rendering engine, or are we also talking about the browser as an interactive platform, even if we're still ignoring the network? You can tinker with the code behind the rendering or with the code behind the interaction, even while the interaction is actually going on. That itself is a paradigm that doesn't hardly cease to exist anywhere else. For example, you can't do that with a car really. You can't open up the engine and put the fan belt on a different ?flywheel? while its moving, but with a browser inspector you can. That's an amazing way to think about design, as a machine but one that you can manipulate in real time. 
</div>
</section>


<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> That taps into another question that Professor Lucy Hitchcock said after your lecture, "There's really something happening in our field where theres the form makers, whether its graphic form or what have you, that illustrate concepts and ideas, and there's the systems makers."  That split struck me because, on one level maybe that's true, maybe that's obvious. Could you see our field as made up by those camps, and if so when did that begin? I think you were a grad around 2000, so you probably have seen much of that split occur if that is indeed the case, and whether that actually needs to be separate piece. 

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> I think that's a useful distinction. I try to find a way to talk about systems as form, so if we're trying to predict the way that people move through a space that movement in us is also a form. I think graphic designers have always been comfortable talking about things like rhythm and color. Its not a problem to think about movement as a kind of form in, for example, a color theory class, or when discussing saul bass film titles or something. If you are talking about the speed or the qualities of how people move through a building that you've done the wayfinding program for, it seems like that's an aspect of the form of that wayfinding system. Similarly, if we think about the rhythms or qualities of how a person navigates their way from section to section of a website, that's also a kind of form just the same way you might think about the rhythm of the hierarchy of a complicated instruction manual as a kind of form. 

</div></section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> and it requires the user to have that play out you think? or is it actually inherently there. 

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> Yeah, I think that's a good point. I don't think it's new honestly. It requires the user to play out, but isn't that true if you think about a reader as well, and then ultimately when you're designing typographic hierarchy? I think we got used to thinking about those things as being things in themselves and yes I can see the typographic hierarchy as an image on my retina, but actually it's always been about the reader. There were some really great systems thinkers in the 50s, and I wonder whether for a while we forgot about that and started to think of these beautiful finished compositions. The signifiers of "good design" took on a life of their own. If you think about Herbert Bear or sudenar (7:55)??? Form is always something that is serving a function, and function is something that is completed by a reader or consumer or user, and we think to the experience of those things always as a part of the design. It's not to contradict Lucy's point at all, but just to say I don't think it's entirely new, but its an important aspect about how to think about Graphic Design. Also,  I would try not to describe it as a formless idea (some people maybe would, and it may be useful to talk about drawing a distinction between content and form and experience and form) but I actually think it's nice to think about what are the formal qualities of an experience. 

</div></section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> I've been looking at the graphic design now in production catalogue and andrew and ellen and jessica helfend are coming to do a panel in a month or two, the show's coming here, so I think its been 3 years since the show went up, its probably been curated 4, 5 years ago. Most of it is graphic form/ graphic art, there is something to chew on the ?? Poster wall is there because it produced a wall full of digital posters and so I wonder were you comfortable with the way that show was curated or worded, Even the sections like information design, posters, and if so then what are your thoughts on it now as far as how it describes the profession because Yale still describes itself as there is Graphic Design within the school of art, so you share that term with the walker, the cooper-hewitt in a sense

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> I don't mind the term Graphic Design at all. It's such a nebulous term. Like I said, I think it's a pretty open-ended term to describe ourselves that way. I think that visual form is really important too, and people might disagree about whether our work is beautiful or not but it ought to be. We're trying to make beautiful work, and we're trying to make beautiful outcomes, even if that work is sometimes completed by other constituents. I don't necessarily think that the focus on two dimensional form is misplaced. You can imagine in a more progressive way to categorize work that isn't so much about genres of finished work, but [instead] is about genres of process, or genres of functionalities, or different kinds of systems. Is it ????12:00  systems, real-time applications, Thats a funny distinction between functionality and visual design that we get caught up in sometimes. It is hard for us to capture the beauty of our work in a single screen grab, and that's something that we struggle with in a practical way just working on a website. Right now we decided we should, on the homepage of our website,  be a little bit more marketing focused and feature 4 case studies. We just made it quickly, but right now these 4 studies lead with just a screen grab of the homepage which is not particularly compelling. I think those websites are very compelling websites, but it becomes more compelling as the series of screens accumulates through your experience moving through the site, even just its more compelling to scroll down ??? than it is to just see whats above the fold for example. So to address all those questions as to how do you distill an experience into an image, I don't think its a question of whether that experience is formally beautiful or not, I mean I would argue that it is, but even as visual design, but how do you take a crop of it, either through time or through space, is tough, so to your point its just a fact of communication and our salesmanship that you do need to find ways to summarize, give an elevated pitch, that there should be a compelling screen grab that can tell the story of whats good about a website, and maybe that's also part of being a good designer is that it has that level as well. 

How does (14:30???) play into this, the all-seeing eye


</div></section>
<section>
<span>Dan:</span> Its a reaction to that in a way that if we could just capture every single state of every website that we ever made than that would be a way to more accurately represent what we've done as it has unfolded over years, and another cool feature of ?? is that it can capture what I call comic strips of an end-user's use of a site, so if you are a web designer, or if you're organizing a urban game like midnight madness, the tragedy is that you never know what people are actually doing, what the users or players are actually doing with your thing, and that's what its all about. If you make a poster you pretty much know or you don't care looking at it what their experience is, but it's still fun to go out, you know, to the bus shelter and see people looking at your poster but theres nothing surprising, its just gratifying, but with a website you want to know what are the paths that people are taking or with an urban game you want to know how people are stumped, or how they are having fun, which way are they going and how are they using it, but you can't be there. In later iterations of midnight madness, the urban game, technology has advanced enough that we actually could be outside organizing the game in real time, so that did allow us to get some cross-sections or glimpses through the progression of the game. but in earlier years we would all take turns, we would be holed up in our game headquarters and if  there was a part of the game that broke everyone would be dying to be the one that would go out and fix it because it would give you the chance to cruse by and see players doing their thing. Once we had this mobile technology we could have our game headquarters be in a park, the first thing that happened was an interprising team stole our packet of clues, they said once we were actually among the users that of course the users can mess you up, so we became more ??16:55  and flatter but thats also the corresponding loss of security. It became a sort of pure network with all the plusses and minuses of a system like that. So getting back to ??? one thing we can do is we do know the sequence, we can't really spy on peoples screens, its not really possible in real time to know what people see on their screens, but we can spy on the logs of our server, which is a centralized thing but we do. So you can track a user session and say the user number which can be an IP address but actually a more usually its just a long hash of their session ID which is just an anonymous random number, and we know that they viewed this URL followed by this URL followed by this URL followed by this URL, and then what?? can do is render a screen capture, not of their screen which is not really possible,  bur of ??s own screen but of that URL, so what that produces is a comic strip of thumbnails of all the pages that one user viewed in sequence, and then you can see a series of those comic strips of many users, the sequences of pages that they saw, so that becomes a pretty neat way of visualizing how a lot of people use the site more or less at the same time, even moreso than looking at analytics or something like that which shows that as a chart being able to see that, even though its a simulation, its something close to what they saw is a pretty neat situational awareness

</section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> So you'll see the exact image that was there?

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> it can differ a little bit because we're not using their browser and for various other reasons, ???

</div></section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> What is your take on, there certainly is a trend on using user data, probably in a different way then what you're talking about, analytics or what have you, to make design decisions, and obviously when you take that to the extreme it seems like that seems nuts, but you're doing that in a more thoughtful way. How does that influence the iterations that you make and how it plays into things like risk taking and client expectations and then advancements like in the browser and technology where maybe theres just like maybe you can do something else now. so all that knowledge doesn't apply

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> I don't want to get too far away from this question of designing in the browser but our usual approach is to make a guess about how users would behave and also I think it's important to make a stipulation as to how you want users to behave not to just be driven entirely by what users think they want or what they already know that they want based on their experience to date. I think it is really crucial that design be progressive, I mean it's in the word, you are making the feature, so you design for that, but then you look and see if it worked as so if the uptake of your new feature isn't what you wanted relevant to the importance of that feature then you change it 

</div></section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> Does it actually match the hierarchy? I mean is there some way, you want 20% of viewers to actually be playing with this thing do you have an image in your mind, everyone needs to know the biennial if you take the whitney for instance, everyone should know that and should hopefully engage with that content in some way but its likely that 30-50% would want to know like visiting information, the hours. How do you know if its actually the predictions were right. In the sense that whatever they do is whatever they do. To what extent is it that the designs faults or success vs what was going to happen anyways, sort of a cultural moment. 

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> If you are talking about lets say the biennial compared to the opening hours or even something like the whitney's permanent collection online compared to the opening hours, I think there is different kinds of information that need to be conveyed and we would assume that a lot of people wanted the opening hours, so we would go into it with that baseline assumption, even thought that's not the most exciting or interesting thing about the museum, it's not important part of the institutions brand but in one way it is because visiting the institution is actually a big part of the museums brand so I think we make assumptions about what the website is for, and one of the things we know that its for is for people to find out the address of the museum 2:50 ??? so that goes right up at the top. and maybe its not big, but its' at the top, there are different ways of making hierarchy, and with something like the collection or the biennial you look at what percentage of viewers are clicking or landing in that area and if its low and you know that area of the website is a) important to the institution and b) actually well developed on the site which is another factor. There's a lot of museums where the collection is really important but is kinda crap on the website and you shouldn't expect a lot of people to be there, right. Ideally in that case that fact that they're not clicking through ought to drive development of the content. In that case it shouldn't drive you to keep making the link bigger and bigger. but if the content is great already and people aren't getting there, then it does drive you to make the link bigger and bigger in some sense.
I had a question about the word "browser"
You talk about the word browser as designing with the browser or designing for the browser? are we talking about browsers or are we talking about HTML as a design language? 

</div></section>
<section>
<div><span>Q:</span> We are talking about the browser itself as a rendering engine. its ability to accept server data, its ability to compute on the fly, your ability as the maker/ designer. You're interrogating it as a maker, but its the  maker not an end user. cutting out the end user, maybe that's where the line is. What can we do with this as a replacement. So HTML and CSS become defacto base to what the browser wants.

</div><div>
<span>Dan:</span> You're not literally designing in the inspector actually that actually kind of a neat idea, you have a text editor and you've got this other tool as well that then is rendered by the browser.

              <h1>Questions for Jurg talks to Philippe Cao, Dan Giuditta</h1>
            

            

            
            <p>Did you start learning to code or draw first? Did it happen simultaneously? How did you get into it?</p>

<p>Could you talk about your relationship to code? Do you still write the code for your projects or do you collaborate with a developer? Do the mechanics and constraints of code inform your process in a fluid way or do you start with the concept in mind and try to execute it however the project demands?</p>

<p>In each of your pieces, what constitutes the final work? Do you consider Hector or Viktor, the machines themselves, to be the work of art, or is it the drawing they create? Or, could it be the ‘performance’ of the machines creating the final outputs?</p>

<p>Can you talk about the disconnect between a smooth vector line and a stepper motor drawing that line with chalk? Is there something about the medium and the translation through mediums that adds value to the final output?</p>

<p>I’m very interested in the way your work highlights the intersection of alternate forms of communication: computers interpreting human language, mechanical servos interpreting code, humans interpreting coded objects such as punch cards… Are you intentionally trying to put these things in conflict with each other? If so what appeals to you about this kind of tension?</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that works like Hektor, Empty Words, Moving Picture Show, are all very open about revealing the mechanisms of the tools themselves. Is this an intentional choice, and if so why do you think it’s important to do so?</p>

<p>Your use of the Speed-I-Jet seems to really emphasize the idea of instant reproducibility, both of content and of form. What draws you to this act of repetition? Is it just a byproduct of working with machines?</p>

<p>Some of my first exposure to scripting was through Scriptographer. When you announced that you would no longer release new versions because of Adobe’s attitude towards API’s, I felt like the design community lost a valuable tool. Were there other considerations to ending development on Scriptographer besides Adobe’s stance? Philosophically would you rather build a tool for an open environment than a widely used closed one?</p>

<p>Now that the digital and mechanical tools you incorporate in your work (i.e. the die-cutting machine in Empty Words, or even a browser) are becoming proprietary objects, are the politics of the companies that create these tools something you consider when creating your work? Just like the shape of a brush creates different forms, do you think the intentions or desires of the companies behind these tools shape an artist/designer’s final output?</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:</p>

                    <p>I am interested in the assistant position advertised in XXX. I am currently employed as Legislative Director for Assemblywoman XXXX, Chairperson of the NYS Assembly XXX. I accepted this position because of the emphasis on the writing and research skills which are applicable to your requirements for an author’s assistant. My experience in the NYS Assembly has afforded me the opportunity to become familiar with the consolidated and unconsolidated laws of the State of New York. I also have extensive experience in legal and policy research.</p>

                    <p>In my position as Legislative Director for Ms. XXX, I prepare her personal legislation which deals with issues relative to her position as Senior Member of the NYS Assembly Standing Committee on XXXX. In as much as she is Chairperson of the XXX Committee I am, of course, heavily involved in the current welfare and Medicaid reform movement.</p>

                    <p>In response to your search for an assistant, I believe my experience in the Legislature, and my research and writing skills qualify me for consideration. If you would like, I can provide you with current samples of my work.</p>

                    <p>To further acquaint you with the specifics of my background I am enclosing my resume. I hope you will consider me for this position. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.</p>

                

                    <p>Sincerely,

              <h1>The browser is all grown up</h1>
              <div class="author">John Caserta</div>
            

            

            
            <p>The graphical browser turned 20 years old last year. NCSA Mosaic, created at the University of Illinois, was able to support the Compuserv Gif format. Designers began to drop images of all sorts in the browser. At times, complete designs (like version 1 of The New York Times). The workflow was from print to web.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, the browser is a formidable means of displaying graphic work. Etc.</p>

<p>I find myself increasingly disdainful of all the palettes required when designing print pieces with Adobe products. It’s not really Adobe’s fault. First it was Aldus Pagemaker, then QuarkXPress, and now Adobe InDesign. The conveniences are manifold, but with each tool comes opportunity and limitation. </p>

<p>My tool of choice for most any project – posters, documents, and even books – is the Web browser. The browser is not even a tool, really, it’s the rendering engine that compiles text instructions.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a great pull quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every tool has its purpose. Early dot matrix output was based on an infinite scroll of paper, perforated to allow for tearing. The need to control or managed the display of the data seems perfunctory. </p>

<p>David Reinfurt refers to responsivity as an important aspect of process. That a process of immediate feedback is valuable in terms of making adjustments. Tools for making that allow for an “aha” moment seem critical when faced when infinite options. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Hey this inline HTML but you can't even tell </p>

<p>I have been using the Web Inspector for the last couple years to make adjustments to designs. Designing patterns is perhaps the simplest way to make this process clear. Whereas a dialog box might be needed to make global adjustments in Illustrator, altering margins or border width in the browser can provide immediate access to a multitude of ideas.  </p>

<pre><code>var plustwo = function(x) {
  return x + 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This real-time working process, where the rendering engine and the tool become one. The volley between plan and result gets collapsed into one act. This is more than an issue of speed. There is a cognitive shift, from pre-meditated to reactive. Each tap of the keyboard alters one number, but in doing so, the entirety of the composition changes.  </p>

<p>Moving a mouse with your hand while looking at how the screen translates that act has its own potential for surprise. But it’s really a simulation of a purely manual acts, such as collaging images together. And although adjusting numbers in the browser’s Web Inspector is quantitative, it is more identical to collage than WYSIWYG design methods.</p>

<p>In regards to practical project</p>

<p>Eugeny Morozov reminds us that the Internet and the browser will likely be a blip in the greater effort of technical advancement. </p>

<p>Paul Soullelis questioned where slowness is the more rare attribute.    </p>
