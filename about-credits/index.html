    This collection of conversations and graphic output was produced in a spring 2014 course titled "HTML Output" at The Rhode Island School of Design. The book was edited by the instructor, John Caserta. The website was created by all the students, with additional assistance by Catherine Leigh Schmidt and Lukas WinklerPrins. The book layout engine, Bindery.js, was created by Evan Brooks.

<p>
    All interviews were performed between Febuary and May, 2014. We would like to thank the many practitioners who agreed to be interviewed for the project. Interviews were edited for readability and length. All work remains the copyright of the student or interviewee.
