    This collection of conversations and graphic output was produced in a spring 2014 course titled "HTML Output" at The Rhode Island School of Design. All projects and work remain the copyright of the student or interviewee. 
</p>
<p>
    All interviews were performed between Febuary and May, 2014. We would like to thank the many practitioners who agreed to be interviewed for the project. Interviews were edited for readability and length.
