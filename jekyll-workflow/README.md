# Hey HTML Outputters!

Here's how this works.

## File structure

1. Make a folder for your project, essay, or interview

2. Create either an index.html file or index.md file.

3. Put in the appropriate information (title, author etc) in YAML format. You can use the interview-sample or project-sample as a template to get started, the dashes are important!

3. Put all assets (images, code, etc) in that folder.


## Running Jekyll

__If you have Jekyll installed locally__

1. Navigate to _this_ folder in the terminal and type 'jekyll serve'.

2. Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

__If you don't want to install Jekyll or deal with the terminal__

1. Commit and push your changes

2. Go to [risd-gd.github.io/htmloutput/jekyll-workflow/](http://risd-gd.github.io/htmloutput/jekyll-workflow/)
