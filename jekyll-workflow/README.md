# Hey HTML Outputters!

Here's how this works.

---

## File structure

1. Make a folder for your project, essay, or interview

2. Create either an index.html file or index.md file.

3. Put in the appropriate information (title, author etc) in YAML format. You can use the interview-sample or project-sample as a template to get started, the dashes are important!

3. Put all assets (images, code, etc) in that folder.

## Viewing the site

_If you have Jekyll installed locally_

1. Navigate to the jekyll-workflow folder in the terminal and type `jekyll serve -w`. 

	The `-w` means 'watch.' That means every time you make a change to a file, jekyll will run `serve` and generate a site again. Press `Ctrl-C` to cancel watching, or just close the terminal window.

2. Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)


_If you don't want to install Jekyll or deal with the terminal_

1. Commit and push your changes

2. Go to [risd-gd.github.io/htmloutput/jekyll-workflow/](http://risd-gd.github.io/htmloutput/jekyll-workflow/)
